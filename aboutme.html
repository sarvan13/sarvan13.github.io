                Hi, I'm Sarvan! I am currently a Master's student at the University of Victoria researching safe and stable AI based robotic systems. Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer 
                at Amazon Web Services (AWS), specifically in the AWS Marketplace organization. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics from the University of British Columbia (UBC) with distinction in 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently looking for PhD opportunities focusing on the implementation of AI based robotic systems in society. For Japanese schools, I have passed the first screening of the MEXT scholarship and am currently
                looking to obtain a letter of provisional acceptance to receive the scholarship.
